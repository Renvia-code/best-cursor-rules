# Tool Usage for This Repository

## Tool Selection Strategy

### codebase_search (Semantic Search)

**When to use**:
- Finding rules by topic or concept
- Understanding how similar rules are structured
- Discovering patterns across multiple rules

**Examples**:
```
✅ "How do other rules handle React patterns?"
✅ "What's the structure for backend rules?"
✅ "Find rules related to testing"
```

**Don't use for**:
```
❌ Finding specific file names (use glob_file_search)
❌ Exact text matches (use grep)
❌ Known file paths (use read_file)
```

---

### grep (Exact Text Search)

**When to use**:
- Finding specific patterns in rules
- Locating frontmatter fields
- Finding all rules with certain globs

**Examples**:
```bash
✅ grep("alwaysApply: true")      # Find always-on rules
✅ grep("globs:.*\\.tsx")         # Find TypeScript rules
✅ grep("## Common Mistakes")     # Find rules with this section
```

---

### glob_file_search (Find Files)

**When to use**:
- Listing all rules in a category
- Finding rules by name pattern
- Getting file counts

**Examples**:
```
✅ glob_file_search("rules/frameworks/*.mdc")
✅ glob_file_search("**/*react*.mdc")
✅ glob_file_search("rules/**/*.mdc")
```

---

### read_file (Direct Access)

**When to use**:
- Reading a specific rule file
- Checking rule format/structure
- Reviewing before editing

**Examples**:
```
✅ read_file("rules/frameworks/nextjs-15.mdc")
✅ read_file(".cursor/rules/01-rule-format.mdc")
```

---

## Parallel Operations

### ✅ DO: Read multiple rules at once

```javascript
// When comparing or reviewing multiple rules
read_file('rules/frameworks/nextjs-15.mdc')
read_file('rules/frameworks/react-19.mdc')
read_file('rules/backends/supabase.mdc')
// All execute in parallel
```

### ❌ DON'T: Read sequentially when independent

```javascript
// Slow - waits between each
read_file('rules/frameworks/nextjs-15.mdc')
// wait...
read_file('rules/frameworks/react-19.mdc')
// wait...
```

---

## Common Tasks

### Adding a new rule

```
1. glob_file_search("rules/{category}/*.mdc")  # See existing
2. read_file(".cursor/rules/01-rule-format.mdc")  # Check format
3. read_file("rules/{category}/similar-rule.mdc")  # Reference
4. write("rules/{category}/new-rule.mdc", content)
```

### Updating an existing rule

```
1. read_file("rules/{category}/rule-name.mdc")  # Current content
2. search_replace or write to update
3. Verify frontmatter is still valid
```

### Finding all rules in a category

```
glob_file_search("rules/frameworks/*.mdc")
```

### Checking rule quality

```
1. read_file("rules/{category}/rule-name.mdc")
2. Check: frontmatter valid?
3. Check: under 500 lines?
4. Check: has code examples?
5. Check: current for 2025?
```

## File Operations

### Creating Files
- Use `write` for new rules
- Always include proper frontmatter
- Place in correct category directory

### Editing Files
- Use `read_file` first to see current state
- Use `search_replace` for precise changes
- Verify frontmatter remains valid after edits

### Moving/Renaming
- Delete old file, create new one
- Update any references in README

## Efficiency Tips

1. **Batch reads** - Read multiple related files in parallel
2. **Search first** - Use grep/glob before reading everything
3. **Check format** - Reference `01-rule-format.mdc` when creating
4. **Verify category** - Make sure rule is in the right directory
5. **Test locally** - Copy rule to a test project to verify it works
