# Contributor Guide

## Quick Start

1. Find the right category in `rules/`
2. Create or edit an `.mdc` file
3. Follow the format in `01-rule-format.mdc`
4. Test the rule in a real project
5. Submit PR

---

## Adding a New Rule

### Step 1: Check if it exists

```bash
# Search existing rules
ls rules/**/*.mdc | grep -i "your-topic"
```

### Step 2: Choose the right category

| Category | What belongs here |
|----------|-------------------|
| `frameworks/` | React, Next.js, Vue, Svelte, Angular, Astro |
| `languages/` | TypeScript, Python, Go, Rust, etc. |
| `backends/` | Supabase, FastAPI, Express, Django |
| `mobile/` | React Native, Flutter, SwiftUI |
| `styling/` | Tailwind, CSS modules, shadcn/ui |
| `testing/` | Vitest, Jest, Playwright, Cypress |
| `best-practices/` | Clean code, security, accessibility |
| `stacks/` | Combined presets (T3, LAMP, etc.) |

### Step 3: Create the file

```bash
# Example: Adding a new framework rule
touch rules/frameworks/remix.mdc
```

### Step 4: Write the rule

Follow the template:

```markdown
---
description: [What this rule helps with - 1-2 sentences]
globs: ["**/*.tsx", "**/*.ts"]
alwaysApply: false
---

# [Framework/Topic Name]

## Overview
[Brief intro - what, why, when]

## Key Patterns
[The most important stuff first]

## Examples
[Real code examples]

## Common Mistakes

## Editing Existing Rules

### When to edit

✅ Outdated information (old API, deprecated patterns)
✅ Missing important patterns
✅ Incorrect examples
✅ Typos or unclear language

### When NOT to edit

❌ Personal preference changes
❌ Adding niche edge cases
❌ Restructuring without clear benefit

---

## Quality Standards

### Must Have

- [ ] Valid MDC frontmatter
- [ ] Clear, tested code examples
- [ ] Current for 2025 (latest stable versions)
- [ ] Under 500 lines
- [ ] No duplicate content from other rules

### Nice to Have

- [ ] Tables for quick reference
- [ ] ✅/❌ do/don't examples
- [ ] Links to official docs
- [ ] Common gotchas section

---

## Writing Style

### DO write like this

```markdown
Use Server Components by default. Only add 'use client' when you need 
browser APIs or interactivity.
```

### DON'T write like this

```markdown
It is recommended that developers consider utilizing Server Components 
as the default paradigm for their applications, and only transition to 
Client Components when necessitated by requirements for browser-specific 
APIs or interactive user interface elements.
```

### Key principles

- **Direct** - Get to the point
- **Practical** - Real examples, not theory
- **Scannable** - Headers, bullets, tables
- **Current** - 2025 best practices
- **Human** - Write like you're helping a friend

## Testing Your Rule

Before submitting:

1. Copy the rule to a test project's `.cursor/rules/`
2. Open files that match the globs
3. Ask Cursor to help with something related
4. Verify it follows your rule's guidance
5. Check edge cases
